## About
### Motivation
The motivation for this project stemmed from wanting to collaborate with peers on a side project we could showcase; while taking the opportunity to gain experience with some of React's newest features. The purpose of Cost Calculator is to provide users a visual representation of how much they need to work on a monthly basis to be able to save or afford expenses.
